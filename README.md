I'm a self-taught developer with experience designing, delivering, and implementing data-driven web applications for clients. I'm familiar with technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to design responsive web pages, write well-designed testable code, create website layouts, integrate data from back-end services, create and maintain software documentation, and cooperate with web designers.
